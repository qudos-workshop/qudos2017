<p class="bodytext"><b>Industrial Keynote</b> (Chair: Elisabetta Di Nitto)</p>
<p class="bodytext">Francesco Chicchiricc&ograve; (CEO of Tirasa) - <b>DevOps Practices and Tools of a Small Company in Love with Open Source</b> <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/ilgrosso/devops-practices-and-tools-of-a-small-company-in-love-with-open-source">[Slides]</a></p>
<p class="bodytext">After his traineeship at The Nokia Research Center in Helsinki, and his Master Degree in 2001 at The University of L’Aquila, he started working as pre-sales and delivery consultant for Sun Microsystems for two years before starting his first company ePOSSE.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Working in ePOSSE as Sun Microsystems supplier in the area of pre-sales, delivery and training for Italian and international customers, he acquired skills and experience in the field of Identity and Access Management (IAM).</p>
<p class="bodytext">In 2011, alongside with some former colleagues, he started Tirasa, having mission to create and leverage Open Source tools for Enterprise Integration, with particular reference to the IAM area. Tirasa builds and supports mission-critical secure solutions to manage digital identities and user federation and access control across different environments including cloud, social networks, and mobile. Thanks to the consolidated experience of its team into the field of Identity and Access Management, Tirasa conceived, developed and later donated to the Apache Software Foundation the Open Source Identity Manager Apache Syncope. Since then, Tirasa continues to lead the development as main sponsor.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><b>Abstract: </b>The objectives of constantly delivering business and customer value, shortening feedback loops, keep experimenting and learning, are undoubtedly at the core of the whole concept of DevOps.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Nowadays, several tools are available to help organizations getting the grasp of at least a subset of such principles. Some of such tools became so relevant to be integrated into the standardized procedures and practices within Open Source organizations as The Apache Software Foundation, where the need to construct software artifacts requires first building up communities.</p>
<p class="bodytext">It might happen then that companies, with technical staff largely involved with Open Source projects, start applying the same practices and tools to their internal development activities, with positive returns for company’s business and customers.</p>

<p class="bodytext">Antinisca Di Marco (L'Universit&agrave; degli Studi dell'Aquila) - <b>DevOps and WSN App: a Bio-Inspired Paradigm</b></p>
<p class="bodytext">Dr. Antinisca Di Marco is Assistant Professor in Computer Science at the Department of Applied Clinical Science and Biotechnologies of University of L'Aquila. In January 2015, she obtained the Associate Professor Habilitation, ASN, MIUR. She is part of the Board of ICT Ph.D. Program of DISIM Department and since July 2015 she is the Director of the UDA Node of the INFOLIFE CINI Laboratory. She is one of the founder of SMARTLY s.r.l., a spin-off of University of L'Aquila, born in May 2014.</p>
<p>Her research interests are in the eld of software engineering and include QoS analysis of autonomic services, context-aware mobile software systems and WSN systems, to support software adaptation, bio-inspired adaptation mechanisms. She is also interested in the development of Health and mobile health service and systems. She published a manuscript and 50 papers in international conferences and
journals. She has been member of several national and European research projects. She has been part of many Program Committee of conferences and workshops. She is local chair of ICPE2017, and program Chair of EPEW2017 and of the CINI INFOLIFE workshop 2017.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><b>Abstract: </b>Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) are nowadays applied to a wide set of domains (e.g., security, health). WSN are networks of spatially distributed, radio-communicating, battery-powered, autonomous sensor nodes. WSN are characterized by scarcity of resources, hence an application running on them should carefully manage its resources. Applications running on WSN (namely, WSN App) and using sensors, must be adaptable to modify their behavior at run-time to respond to changes in the environment they run, to changes of the users' requirements or to changes occurring in the system itself.</p>
<p class="bodytext">This talk will present a bio-inspired paradigm that mimics the cell lifecycle and uses the concept of membrane to dene the border of a system adaptation. The adaptation is species by PROTEUS a language for reconguration plans. The talk will show the application of such a paradigm to WSN domain through the MAIA framework (FraMework for Adaptaptive wIreless sensor network Applications). MAIA provides components i) to model and analysis quality attributes (timing, performance and energy consumption) of AGILLA agents running on sensor nodes, ii) to generate AGILLA code from the provided models and to dynamically delivery the generated code on WSN. MAIA supports DevOps process for WSN App.</p>
